- 👋 Hi, I’m @DevTaylor better known as Rainier Dirawatun
- 👀 I’m interested in making a significant impact on the generations that come after me with the super power that is coding.
- 🌱 I’m currently working on my first personal website @ rainier.codes using REACT.js, react-spring, and node back end.
- 💞️ I’m looking to continue pushing my projects forward in the form of sprints. Next up? mathly.io, a website I founded and am
      pivoting both on our value proposition and our tech stack. Yup, my prior business partner and original CTO of mathly.io has
      agreed to help bring mathly.io to life using Angular and .NET core as its backbone. This new tech stack will leverage its 
      special features to make mathly.io better than ever before! More to come Spring 2022.
- 📫 How to reach me? You can message me at rainier@rainier.codes if you are interested in a collaboration or a business inquiry.
